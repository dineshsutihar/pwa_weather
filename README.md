## Introduction
Here we will be building a Weather Progressive Web Application (PWA). A PWA is a web application that can be installed on your device and work offline. It works on all devices and provides a native app like experience.

It is just a basic weather PWA that shows the weather of the current location of the user. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data.

I have created this project to understand the concept of Progressive Web Application (PWA) and how to build a PWA using React.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server


1. // Todo: add city names recommendations in the search bar
2. // Todo: replace the default weather status image with animated weather status images like gif
3. // Todo: add more weather data like humidity, wind speed, AQI, etc.
